        <h2> <p>Hello, I’m Sumit Sharma, a passionate and driven individual with a keen interest in cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing my studies in this field, aiming to contribute to making the digital world a safer place. In addition to my cybersecurity ambitions, I have a foundational knowledge of web development, particularly in HTML and CSS. I enjoy using these skills to create dynamic and engaging websites.

            This portfolio is a live demonstration of my web development skills, where you can explore my work and see how much I’ve learned so far. Outside of my academic pursuits, I am a highly creative person with a love for chess, sketching, and traveling. These hobbies not only provide me with relaxation but also help enhance my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Always eager to learn, I approach challenges with an open mind and a commitment to growth in both my personal and professional life.
            
            If you have any suggestions on how I can improve my work or the overall design, feel free to connect with me through my social media accounts listed on the homepage. I’m always open to feedback and eager to improve.
            
            </p>
